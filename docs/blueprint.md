- Primary color: Deep red (#A32638) to evoke warmth and cultural richness, inspired by traditional Nepali colors.
- Background color: Off-white (#F2EFE9) to provide a soft, inviting backdrop that complements the red and gold accents. This color ensures readability and visual comfort.
- Accent color: Gold (#D4AF37) for highlights and interactive elements, adding a touch of luxury and echoing the golden hues often found in Nepali art and architecture.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif for a warm and readable feeling that can be used throughout the page for titles and body text
- Use custom icons with a line art style, incorporating elements of Nepali art and symbolism. These icons should be used sparingly to guide users without overwhelming them.
- Use a grid-based layout to organize the content in a clean and structured manner. Ensure that reviews are easily scannable with clear headings, star ratings, and excerpt previews.
- Implement subtle transitions and hover effects to provide feedback on user interactions and enhance the overall experience. Animations should be smooth and unobtrusive, adding a layer of polish without distracting from the content.
